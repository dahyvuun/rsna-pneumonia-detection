# rsna-pneumonia-detection

## üìò Project Overview

This project compares YOLOv8‚Äôs built-in Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) with a custom NMS method using the `ensemble-boxes` library. It is applied to a subset of the RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset to validate and analyze detection performance.

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

- `nms_compare.py`: Main evaluation script
- `utils.py`: Helper functions for box conversion, matching, metrics
- `results.txt`: Precision/Recall/F1 results (see below)
- `rsna_pneumonia/`: Subset of images/labels + YOLO `.pt` weights
